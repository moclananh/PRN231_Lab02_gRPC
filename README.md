# gRPC Demo Project

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the use of gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) in a .NET application. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework for remote procedure calls, which can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication.

## Key Features
- **gRPC Service**: Defines and implements a gRPC service.
- **Client Application**: Consumes the gRPC service to perform operations.
- **Protocol Buffers**: Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient serialization.
- **Streaming**: Demonstrates unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming.

## Technical Details
- **Backend**: .NET Core for gRPC service implementation.
- **Frontend**: .NET Core client application for service consumption.
- **Serialization**: Protocol Buffers for data exchange.
